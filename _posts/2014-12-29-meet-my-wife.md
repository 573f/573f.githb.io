My wife, Camille, is an Occupational Theraptist or OT. Occupational Therapy is one of the unsung heroes of the medical profession. Everything you do as a part of your normal life is an "occupation"; brushing your teeth, cooking dinner, doing the laundry, getting dressed, or playing a musical instrument. OTs teach people who've suffered terrible injuries how to do those things again. Camille is one of the best. She lives her life by one simple mantra: Touch the Heart. Over the past 20+ years, she has touched the hearts of thousands of clients. She has treated them using her compassion, her caring and her boundless capacity for giving. During that time, she has also published countless papers, presented her research on both the national and internationl stage, and published two books. Her contributions have been recognized by her peers as significantly advancing the field and they named her a Fellow of the American Occupational Therapy Association, the highest honor of her discipline. In addition, she somehow found the time to raise two children, get her Ph.D., and start a new career as a University Professor. She teaches a new batch of OT students to carry on her style of compassionate therapy every year. Camille stands at the center of an ever growing circle of changed lives. Lives that are now lived independently and with dignity. Camille makes the world a better place. She is **magnificent**.

For reasons that beggar the imagination, she chose me to be her life partner, her husband, the father of her children and her friend. I could not be more lucky.
