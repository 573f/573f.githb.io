title: "Postel's Law for a Peaceful Holiday Season"
subtitle: "Is this really how you want to be?"
---
As many a geek knows, Postel's Law (or the [Robustness Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle)) eases the interoperability of diverse systems. It states:

> BE CONSERVATIVE IN WHAT YOU DO, <br/>
> BE LIBERAL IN WHAT YOU ACCEPT FROM OTHERS.

We can also apply this to relieve tensions between people who celebrate different mid-winter holidays. Postel's Law is a recipe for peace. Instead of getting bent out of shape when someone you barely know (and who barely knows you) gives you the traditional greeting of a holiday you don't happen to observe, **accept it in the spirit in which it was given**. Accept the idea that you have been wished joy and happiness in the season - no matter what the form of that wish.
