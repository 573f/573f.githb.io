My first Raspberry Pi arrived. I was a little disappointed that the NOOBS card I ordered did not have the current version of Raspbian (Raspberry + Debian) and that I didn't notice that until I had installed and booted up for the first time.

Fortunately, it was easy to [download and install](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) the latest version and I was up and running. 

I specifically wanted the Pi to begin experimenting and learning the [Wolfram Language](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/). Raspbian is the [first platform on which its available](http://www.wolfram.com/raspberry-pi/). More platforms are coming, as Wolfram is just now rolling this out. I'm certain I'll be getting on board with Mac OS X and/or the cloud versions as soon as they are available.

For now, I will start learning on the Pi.
