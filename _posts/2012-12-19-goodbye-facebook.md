I am leaving Facebook. I am not just logging off forever, I am permanently deleting my account. 

As you may have read in the intertubes, Facebook revised their privacy model sometime in the last couple of weeks. When you next logged into Facebook, you were presented with a notice about the change and an opportunity to review you privacy settings under the new policy. Most people will see the notice, skim it, and accept the new default privacy settings. 

This is in itself bad enough, as it means that it is all too easy for a company like Facebook wanted to take advantage of their users trust. For instance, that company could take information you previously considered personal and suitable only for your friends, and redefine it as public. Which makes it available for Google to index, for employers and insurance companies to mine, and government agencies to examine.

**_Which is exactly what Facebook did_**. They have decided that you no longer get to control your information, and that some of that information will now be public.

And if that isn't bad enough, I've since learned that when you grant permission for some little quiz or game to your Facebook account, you also grant it the right to yours friends information as well. The permission you grant to the Facebook application supersedes your carefully constructed permissions settings.

For me, the benefits of participation in Facebook no longer outweigh the costs. I simply cannot, in good conscience, expose my friends to who knows what through their contact with my Facebook account. Nor do I wish my personal information to be exposed through the innocent actions of those same friends.

For further information, I recommend the following:

- The [Electronic Freedom Foundation](http://www.eff.org/) has an excellent article on the details of this issue, and provides much supporting evidence.
- Jason Calacanis also has written an [interesting and insightful article](http://calacanis.com/2009/12/13/is-facebook-unethical-clueless-or-unlucky/) on his blog.
- This [short article in Bruce Schnier's Cryptogram](http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0912.html#4) discusses different kinds of information that can be gathering from social networking sites like Facebook. This is worth a read just to realize what companies can do with what you think is innocent information.

Finally, [this is an example of how companies are manipulating social network users](http://www.businessinsider.com/health-insures-caught-paying-facebook-users-virtual-currency-to-send-letters-to-congress-opposing-reform-bill-2009-12) for their own ends.

Goodbye all my Facebook friends, see you somewhere more private, secure and respectable.
