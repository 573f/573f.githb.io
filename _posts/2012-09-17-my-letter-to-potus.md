Dear Mr. President,

The public healthcare debate over the last several months has been anything but civil. Town hall meetings degrade into shouting matches and scuffles. Protesters bring weapons to public events. Their antics make reasonable, civil discourse impossible. They are filled with hate and bile, and yet do not know even the basic facts about the issue or the proposed legislation. They are simply there to disrupt the proceedings.

One can't help but wonder what motivates such people. Is it fear? What are they afraid of? Do they fear a loss of freedom? Do they fear freedom of choice? Do they fear that their children will grow up in a country they no longer recognize? Do they fear that if given an informed choice, their children will choose something other than what their parents would want?

Please do not let this sub-culture of fear-mongering screamers derail your attempts to provide healthcare for all.

When it comes to healthcare, we are not free. We are only given the "choice" of the company to which we will pay exorbitant fees. A company that will, given the option, cancel that same paid coverage when we become injured or ill. Within the clutches of the insurance company moguls, we are only free to suffer, free to die.

As one opponent of healthcare reform said to a pro-reform speaker at a recent townhall meeting, "Why should we pay for your healthcare?". They do not hear, or want to hear, our answer, the answer of compassion, "Why not? I'll be paying for yours, we're all in this together.". I, personally, am willing to pay higher taxes to support universal healthcare. I know that, even if it becomes more than what I pay for healthcare now, it will not be capriciously cancelled when I need it and those who need it most will have it. 

Our country is plagued with drug abuse, domestic violence, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, malnutrition, and many other debilitating and long-term illnesses. How much of our personal time and money is spent dealing with the consequences of these ills? How much happier would we as a nation be if we knew that our healthcare needs were covered? If we didn't have to be worried about getting sick or injured? Or if such an injury or illness would mean the loss of our jobs?

Insurance companies have no incentive to proactively or preventatively treat illness. Associating profit with healthcare is logically flawed. A for-profit healthcare company will do whatever they can to maximize profits, no matter the needs of the patient. This form of healthcare system will drain our coffers, impoverish our people, and diminish us. Such a system contributes to our economic decline. It cannot stand. 

You are in a position not unlike that of FDR and LBJ in attempting to pass a controversial social program against the objections of the republican minority. The Republicans and the right wing populace of this country have made it abundantly clear that they will not accept any form of healthcare reform. Bipartisanship is a pipe-dream. If they will not approve a form of healthcare that will lower costs and provide coverage for every American, do not then let them dilute the legislation with half measures and never-to-be-pulled "triggers". 

Instead, move past the objections of those who will not compromise, and bring about the same right to healthcare as it exists within every other industrialized western nation. Give us universal healthcare. It is what we, the majority of Americans, want. It is just. It is compassionate. It is our right. It will secure the health and well-being of our future generations, and help restore our lives, our liberty, and the pursuit of our happiness.
