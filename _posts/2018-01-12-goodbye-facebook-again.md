# Goodbye, Facebook. Again.

After I left Facebook the first time, it became necessary for me to re-join because Facebook was how my child’s school communicated with parents.

It also allowed me to re-connect with family and friends who don’t seem to communicate in any other way.

But it also subjected me to loads of other stuff in “my” feed. Things that were tangentially related to my interests. At least, my interests as Facebook understood them.

Unfortunately, Facebook also captured too much of my attention. During the 2016 election cycle, Facebook was a constant source of dubiously sourced material that I obsessively followed. 

I wasted a lot of time. A lot. 

And that’s really what did it for me. The attention cost was simply too much. There are so many other things more worthy of my time and attention.  

Time is precious. And Facebook gets no more of mine.
