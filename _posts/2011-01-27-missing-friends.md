Yesterday I learned that an old friend I had not seen in many years had died. It got me thinking about how we lose track of people we once cared about.

Sara<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> was once the long-term live-in girlfriend of my best old ex-friend, Ray<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>. We were, at times, close. Sara was a part of a close circle of friends who all went to high school together and were still hanging out while attending college in the same town. That circle of friends was connected to my circle of friends through Ray. You know how that works, right? At first, we all just tolerate each other at parties and make small talk. Over time though, new connections are formed between other members of the two original circles. Some of those connections are casual, others are romantic and/or sexual.

I’m sure there is some facinating psychological process at work here (me != psychologist, just in case you were wondering), maybe it has something to do with the unspoken agreements not to date friends, or poach another friend’s SO (Significant Other), but that’s not what I’m after here.

I made one of those romantic/sexual connections within the other circle of friends. And after we broke up, and Ray and Sarah broke up, the two original circle of friends no longer attended the same parties and events. Eventually, the larger group of friends and lovers all separated. Some went off as individuals, others broke into smaller sub-groups. It’s almost as though once the main connections were broken, the whole structure came apart. Of course, life in the larger world also intruded upon and impacted the circle(s) of friends microcosm. People moved away, got married, got jobs, whatever.

And let’s face it, it damned awkward to go to a party, dinner, or club where your ex is also, whether you have a new SO or not. So you don’t go (or you do – just out of spite or something, but that’s a different post), and soon you lose touch with “those” people. And you move on to your new life, job, or whatever.

It was my ex who located me through email posts I had made (she must have been using The Google™), and informed my of Sara’s death. Sara died of a drug overdose, and I remember she had a history of battling depression. At the time of her death, I had not seen, or heard of, her in over a decade. We just weren’t “connected” anymore.

I can’t help but think about what might have been different in Sara’s life if she had still had some of her old friends around. I don’t even know what sort of friends she may have had lately. Did her friends fail her? Was she abandoned and alone in the world? Would one more friend have saved her life? I simply don’t know.

If we once cared (or still care) for someone, what is our obligation to that person? Should we at least keep the lines of communication open? Send cards and emails enough to let them know we still care? So that when they fall on hard times or trouble, they know that they can call on us? We may only be able to help them feel less alone, but what if that makes all the difference?

It’s so easy to be lazy and not do these things. You have so much other stuff going on in your job, life, kids, whatever, where can you find the time? But if you don’t make the time, or think “I’ll do it tomorrow” then the days, weeks, and years slip by and before you know it, someone you knew and loved is dead, and there’s no time left at all.

Wouldn’t the world be a better place if we just remembered our friends?
